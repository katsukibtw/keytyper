### Keytyper
Keytyper is an online platform for touch typing education and training.

To set up your own version of Keytyper clone this repository and run following commands

This thing is written using React and Redux (in bare functional without users or any db elements).

	yarn install
	yarn start # to test it on development server
	yarn build # to build production version for deploy

Notice that for using all features of this app you need a backend, but it is not done yet, so it's in a private repo for now.
Backend is written with Express, Sequalize and Cors. Authentication is set on JWT
